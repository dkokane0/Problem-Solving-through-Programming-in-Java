Problem-Solving-through-Programming-in-Java

We want to know how will you design the program for the given below use case,
Using OOPs design principles in Any Programming Language you want
The task for Inheritance and composition,
in the below task you have to use inheritance and encapsulation,
suppose you are making a program for a very famous IoT Inverter company,
the company have multiple inverters with multiple business logic, 
Use cases:
 A company have PCU, GTI, Zelio, Regalia, iCruze Inverters,
 All Inverters have Power rating which is determined by ( Current * Operating Voltage )
 Only PCU, GTI and Regalia are solar Inverters other are not (solar inverters get charge by solar panels and solar energy,
 Solar Inverters have Solar Panels also
 Solar Inverters further have two option one Battery version that whatever energy is produced will be stored in battery other will not
store any energy,so PCU comes with battery but GTI have no battery,
 Solar Inverter also have GRID On , system where you can sell your extra energy back, GTI is GRID On where as this feature is not
available in PCU,
 Non Solar Inverters are Simple Home Inverters Which have a Battery,
